Time complexity is a measure of the time required to run an algorithm as the input size increases.

For brevity, programmers use a way of writing known as Big O notation to represent various magnitudes of time complexity. 

Space complexity is a measure of the memory required for an algorithm to run.

You should know about constant time, logarithmic time, linear time, quadratic time and quasilinear time and be able to order them by cost.

Big O notation is used to represent the general form of time and space complexity.

Time and space complexity are high-level measures of scalability; they do not measure the actual speed of the algorithm itself.

For small data sets, time complexity is usually irrelevant. A quasilinear algorithm can be slower than a quadratic algorithm
