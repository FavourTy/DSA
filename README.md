# DSA
Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning journey! In this repository, I explore various data structures and algorithms using Dart programming language, following the concepts outlined in the book (Data Structures and algorithms in dart by Jonathan Sande) I'm currently studying. This repository serves as a record of my progress and a resource for others who are interested in learning DSA with Dart.

# INTRODUCTION
Data Structures and Algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science that help us solve complex problems efficiently. In this repository, I focus on implementing and understanding these concepts using Dart, a versatile and expressive programming language.

# WHAT'S INCLUDED
* Complexity
* Basic Data Structures
* Stacks
* Linked-Lists
* Stacks
* Queues
* Trees
* Graphs
* Sorting Algorithms
* And  more!!!!

# HOW TO USE THE REPOSITORY
Feel free to explore the code in this repository to deepen your understanding of data structures and algorithms. You can use the code as a reference, study material, or even contribute by improving existing implementations or adding new ones. To get started:
* Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/favourTy/DSA.git
* Explore the Dart files within the repository to study data structures and algorithms implementations.
* Experiment with the code, make improvements, and test different scenarios.

# CONTRIBUTING
Contributions are welcome! If you find bugs, have suggestions for improvements, or want to add new data structures/algorithms implementations, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Let's learn and grow together!
HAPPY CODINGüòòüòç
